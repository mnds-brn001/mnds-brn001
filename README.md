# 👋 Hi, I'm Bruno Mendes

### **Building Decision Layers for Retail & Logistics**

I transform fragmented data into **actionable intelligence** that reduces decision friction.

Most dashboards show metrics. Mine **prescribe actions**.

## 🔥 The Problem
Retail and logistics operations generate massive amounts of data, but **decision-makers are drowning in metrics** without clear actions.

**Common symptoms:**
- Dashboards show "what happened" but not "what to do"
- Teams spend hours analyzing data but can't prioritize actions
- Capital gets misallocated because there's no clear framework
- Dead stock accumulates because there's no automated flagging

**My approach:** Build decision engines that reduce cognitive load. Every metric on screen triggers a specific action. If it doesn't, it shouldn't be there.

## 🚀 Products & Case Studies

### 📊 [Insight Expert • E-commerce Intelligence Platform](https://github.com/mnds-brn001/insightx-ecommerce-dashboard)
**Status:** In active development | **Target:** Retail E-commerce

A BCG-based portfolio analysis tool that classifies product categories into strategic quadrants and prescribes actions:
- ⭐ **Estrela Digital:** Invest heavily (38 categories, R$ 43k in stock)
- 🐄 **Vaca Leiteira:** Optimize margin, harvest profits (29 categories)
- 🧪 **Interrogação:** Test strategies before scaling (51 categories)
- ✂️ **Abacaxi:** Liquidate and discontinue (15 categories, R$ 1.5k immobilized)

**Key insight:** Identified R$ 1,566 in dead stock that costs more in management time than it's worth—actionable intelligence, not just data.

**Tech:** Python, Streamlit, DuckDB, Plotly | **Architecture:** Modular, fast local processing

### 📦 [Supply Chain Analytics](https://github.com/mnds-brn001/supply-chain-dashboard)
Operational dashboard focused on bottleneck visibility and demand forecasting.
- Implementing inventory dynamics and safety stock calculations.
- Focused on reducing "Cognitive Load" for logistics managers under pressure.

## 🎯 Who This Is For

**I work with:**
- E-commerce retailers struggling with inventory decisions
- Logistics operations needing bottleneck visibility
- Teams drowning in data but starving for insights

**I don't work with:**
- Companies that want "dashboards for the sake of dashboards"
- Teams that aren't ready to act on data-driven recommendations
- Projects where "showing metrics" is the end goal

**My promise:** If a metric doesn't trigger a decision, it won't be on your screen.

*When I'm not building decision engines, I explore presence through meditation and movement. A balanced mind produces cleaner code and sharper strategies.*
