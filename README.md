# 👋 Hi, I'm Bruno Mendes

I’m not just building dashboards — I’m building decision engines.
Data for me isn’t about pretty visuals or vanity metrics. It’s about **clarity, foresight, and capital allocation for people who need to decide under pressure.**

My journey didn’t start in analytics labs or consulting decks.
It started inside real operations — dealing with inventory, logistics constraints, performance pressure, trade-offs, and the consequences of decisions made with partial information.

That operational foundation is what shapes everything I build today.

## 🧭 Background & Journey

I have a background in **Systems Analysis & Development**, with focused training in **Data Science, Business Intelligence, and Machine Learning.**

Before transitioning fully into analytics, I worked in **operational and analytical roles**, close to supply chain, planning, and performance monitoring. Being embedded in operations taught me something most dashboards ignore:

> Decisions don’t fail because data is missing — they fail because data is fragmented, late, or misaligned with how the business actually works.

That experience pushed me to design analytics not as reports, but as **decision systems** — tools that help people *reallocate attention, time, and money* with confidence.

Today, I work as a **solopreneur in Data & Analytics**, building focused, high-leverage data products where **insight comes before scale.**

## 🚀 What I Build

**Modern Data** Apps designed to:

- Unify messy, scattered data sources into one coherent narrative

- Reduce cognitive load instead of increasing it

- Reveal trade-offs, trends, and risks before they become problems

- Support strategic decisions, not just monitoring

I care deeply about **signal-to-noise ratio.**
If a metric doesn’t change a decision, it doesn’t belong on the screen.
