# 👋 Hi, I'm Bruno Mendes

I’m not just building dashboards — I’m building decision engines.
Data for me isn’t about pretty visuals or vanity metrics. It’s about clarity, foresight, and momentum for those ready to act.

With a background in Systems Analysis & Development and focused training in Data Science, BI, and Machine Learning, I’ve shaped my own path as a solopreneur in Data & Analytics.

But more than code and pipelines, what drives me is turning the noise of raw data into strategy that moves the needle.

## 🚀 What I Build

Modern Data Apps that:

- Unify messy data sources into one narrative

- Visualize complexity without losing clarity

- Predict, warn, and reveal what really matters

Core Stack: Python · Streamlit · Pandas · Numpy · Scikit-learn · NLP · Plotly · Apache ECharts

💡 Tech is the medium. Insight is the product.

### 🏆 Project Highlights

- **[InsightX • E-commerce Analytics](https://github.com/mnds-brn001/insightx-ecommerce-dashboard)**
  - Specialized analytics platform for e-commerce.
  - Transforms multiple raw sources into a clear business view: CAC, LTV, churn, product performance, and predictive insights.
  - Visualizations, key metrics, and actionable insights.

- **[Supply Chain Analytics](https://github.com/mnds-brn001/supply-chain-dashboard)**
  - Academic dashboard focused on logistics and supply chain analysis.

## 🌱 What’s Next

I’m moving toward a model of Data Apps as a Service, with reinvestment into scale, broader integrations, and deeper ML-powered insights.
The goal? To expand across key economic areas while keeping agility and clarity at the core.
