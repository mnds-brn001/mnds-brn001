# 👋 Hi, I'm Bruno Mendes

I’m building my own path as a solopreneur in Data & Analytics, turning raw information into clarity and strategy.
My background in Systems Analysis and Development, plus focused studies in Data Science, BI, and Machine Learning, gave me the tools.
But what moves me is something maior: crafting data apps that feel alive and solve real problems for businesses.

## 🚀 What I Do

I create modern Data Apps that unify, visualize, and narrate data in a way that businesses can act on.
My stack is Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, NLP, Plotly, and Apache ECharts — but beyond tools, what I deliver is actionable insight.

I see dashboards not as “pretty charts”, but as decision engines: spaces where metrics, context, and foresight meet.

### 🏆 Project Highlights

- **[InsightX E-commerce Dashboard](https://github.com/mnds-brn001/insightx-ecommerce-dashboard)**
  - Specialized analytics platform for e-commerce.
  - Transforms multiple raw sources into a clear business view: CAC, LTV, churn, product performance, and predictive insights.
  - Visualizations, key metrics, and actionable insights.

- **[Supply Chain Dashboard](https://github.com/mnds-brn001/supply-chain-dashboard)**
  - Academic dashboard focused on logistics and supply chain analysis.

## 🌱 What’s Next

I’m moving toward a model of Data Apps as a Service, with reinvestment into scale, broader integrations, and deeper ML-powered insights.
The goal? To expand across key economic areas while keeping agility and clarity at the core.

## 🧘‍♂️ Hobbies

Meditation, breathwork, writing, film, music, and movement — all part of the same search: presence, balance, and creativity.
