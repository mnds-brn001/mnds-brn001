# 👋 Hi, I'm Bruno Mendes

### **Data Professional | Analytics Engineer | Decision Intelligence**

I bridge the gap between complex operations and high-impact data products. 
My goal is to transform fragmented data into **decision engines** that optimize capital allocation and operational efficiency.

## 🧭 The Philosophy
A dashboard that shows 'Revenue by Category' is data. A dashboard that shows 'These 15 categories are bleeding capital—liquidate them' is a signal.
Having spent years inside **supply chain and logistics operations**, I learned that data projects don't fail because of a lack of math, but because of a lack of **context**. 

I build data apps that don't just "show" metrics—they **prescribe action**. I focus on the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: if a metric doesn't trigger a decision, it shouldn't be on the screen.

## 📈 Professional Path
I am currently focused on **Analytics Engineering** and **Data Product Development**. I thrive in environments where:
- Data is treated as a product, not a service.
- There is a high bar for code quality and business impact.
- Collaboration across Product, Tech, and Ops is the standard.

*💡 Tech is the medium. Insight is the result.*

## 🧘‍♂️ Beyond the Code
When I'm not optimizing pipelines, I'm exploring **presence and creativity** through Meditation, Writing, and Movement. I believe that a balanced mind produces cleaner code and sharper strategies.
